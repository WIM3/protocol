Business Value
Via the partnership with we provide signals from assets that are not currently available to
traders, such as S&P500 stocks, commodities, and other markets outside of crypto. Traders Island is also an
improvement on Perpetual Protocol, changing the way orders are executed to gain spot exposure at higher
leverages. Logarithmic perpetuals reduce liquidation risk by taking the log of the underlying asset price
before computing funding payments. This better-behaved funding payment distribution provides for longer
funding periods and a more stable clearing house.

Technical Differentiation
In perpetual futures, short positions on leading exchanges are less desirable to traders than long positions
since these are more likely to be liquidated. The resulting long-short imbalance causes market prices to
improperly reflect expected future spot prices and increases the overall probability of liquidation events.
Taking the log of the underlying assetâ€™s price before computing funding payments eliminates this asymmetry.
